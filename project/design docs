1. Design Objective

The objective of this design is to create a professional, institutional-grade web interface for the Smart Faculty Leave Management System that visually aligns with modern academic portals such as lms.cahcet.in. The design aims to provide a clean layout, consistent branding, easy navigation, and responsive usability across devices.

The system should feel trustworthy, simple to use, and visually consistent with a college learning management system.
