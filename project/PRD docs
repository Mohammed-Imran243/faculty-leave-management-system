1. Product Title

Smart Faculty Leave Management System with Multi-Level Approval and Digital Signatures

2. Purpose

The purpose of this project is to design and implement a web-based system that automates the leave application and approval process for faculty members in an educational institution. The system replaces traditional manual and paper-based leave workflows with a secure digital platform.

The system supports multi-level approvals including substitute faculty verification, departmental approval, and principal authorization. Upon final approval, a digitally signed leave approval document is generated containing signatures from both the respective Head of Department (HOD) and the Principal.

The platform is developed using XAMPP, PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure cost-effective deployment and easy maintenance.

3. Problem Statement

Traditional leave management systems in colleges rely heavily on manual forms and physical approvals, leading to inefficiencies such as:

Delayed approvals due to manual routing of documents.

Risk of data loss and misplacement.

Lack of transparency in leave tracking.

Difficulty in generating historical reports.

Increased administrative workload.

No automated verification of substitute faculty availability.

No secure digital approval documentation.

These issues highlight the need for a centralized, automated, and secure leave management system.
